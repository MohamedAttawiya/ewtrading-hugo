## Documentation package (typical)
Most buyers ask for the same set. We keep it simple and repeatable:

- **TDS**: key properties and recommended use-cases  
- **COA**: batch-specific results aligned with the TDS ranges  
- **MSDS**: supplied upon request depending on destination requirements  

{{< callout title="Tip for faster clearance" tone="ok" >}}
Share your target destination and any local compliance requirements early (e.g., special labeling rules). It reduces back-and-forth and avoids port delays.

## Packaging & handling
We can support common industrial formats based on your handling setup and shipment mode.

- Drums / pails (where applicable)
- Palletized loads with stretch-wrap and corner protection
- Container loading plan aligned to weight distribution

## Lead times & planning
Lead time depends on the grade family, order volume, and packaging configuration.

- Standard grades: typically faster availability  
- Specialty / modified grades: may require scheduling  
- Large volumes: best handled via split shipments if timing is tight
