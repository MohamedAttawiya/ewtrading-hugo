{{< callout title="Buyer-ready exports" tone="info" >}}
We supply alkyd resin grades with export-focused documentation, predictable logistics, and clear commercial terms — built for coating manufacturers and distributors across African markets.

## How our export process works
We approach export shipments as **repeatable commercial flows**, not one-off transactions.  
That means documentation, packaging, and timelines are aligned before production starts.

## Documentation package (typical)
Most buyers ask for the same core documents. We keep this standardized to avoid delays:

- **TDS** – key properties and recommended use-cases  
- **COA** – batch-specific results aligned with TDS ranges  
- **MSDS** – supplied upon request depending on destination requirements  

{{< callout title="Faster clearance tip" tone="ok" >}}
Share your destination country and any local compliance rules early (label language, customs templates, or registration requirements). It significantly reduces clearance time.

## Packaging & shipment planning
Packaging is selected based on handling method, shipment size, and port infrastructure.

- Industrial drums or pails (grade-dependent)
- Palletized loads with stretch-wrap and corner protection
- Container loading plans optimized for weight distribution

## Lead times & availability
Lead times depend on grade family, order size, and packaging configuration.

- Standard grades: shorter production windows  
- Specialty or modified grades: scheduled production  
- Larger volumes: may ship in staged lots to meet delivery windows
